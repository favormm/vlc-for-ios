Compilation
 ---------

Run "BackRowHeaders; ./install.sh" to install the Headers needed for the
FrontRow plugin. BackRow is a private framework of MacOSX, and so the Headers
are not public.

Then open the project in XCode to build it.



Installation
 ----------

Copy VLC.frappliance to /System/Library/CoreServices/Front\ Row.app/Contents/PlugIns . That's all folks !
